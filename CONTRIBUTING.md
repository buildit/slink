# Agreed Team Practices #
- We track work using Github issues and the [project board](https://github.com/buildit/slink/projects/1).
- We use trunk-based development using `master` as "trunk".  
- We encourage the use of _short-lived_ Feature Branches followed by Pull Requests (PRs).
- PR author performs the merge, and we prefer at least one approval from a PR reviewer before merge.
- We encourage Github "squash merges" for branches with messy commits. 
- Minor fixes/doc changes, etc, can go straight to `master`.
